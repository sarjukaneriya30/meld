PRINCIPLES OF OPERATION\n1-8.  ENGINE SYSTEMS.\na. General.\nThe diesel engine is an internal-combustion power unit where the heat energy of fuel is converted into work energy inside the\ncylinder. In a diesel engine, air alone is compressed in the cylinder. After compression, a charge of fuel is sprayed into the\ncylinder where ignition is accomplished by the heat of compression.\nb. Fuel System.\nThe fuel system consists of a fuel pump, strainer (primary filter), filter (secondary filter), injectors, and related fuel lines. The\nintense beat created by the high compression of the air immediately ignites the fine fuel spray. A restricted fitting is located\nat the fuel return to maintain pressure within the fuel system. The fuel pump draws fuel from the vehicle tank through the\nstrainer and forces it through the filter. From the filter, fuel goes through the fuel inlet passage in the cylinder head and through\nthe fuel tubes into the injectors. The fuel passes through a filter element within the injector to a chamber where it is metered,\ndisplaced, and atomized through the fuel injector spray tip into the combustion chamber. Excess fuel not injected cools the\ninjectors and returns through the fuel tubes to the fuel tank.\nc. Lubrication System.\nThe lubrication system consists of an oil intake screen and tube assembly, oil pump, pressure regulator, oil filter, bypass valve,\nand oil cooler. The gear-type oil pump is bolted to the back of the lower front cover and is driven directly by the crankshaft.\nLubricating oil is picked up from the oil pan by the pump. From the pump, it passes from the lower front cover through short\ngallery passages in the cylinder block to the oil filter adapter plate. From the adapter plate, oil flows through the oil filter,\nthrough the oil cooler, back through the lower front cover, and into the cylinder block oil galleries for distribution to the various\nengine bearings. The drains for the cylinder heads and other engine parts lead back to the oil pan. Clean engine oil is assured\nby a replaceable oil filter. Should the filter become clogged, oil will flow through a bypass valve in the adapter plate directly\nto the oil cooler. If the oil cooler becomes clogged, oil will flow directly through a bypass valve in the lower front cover to\nthe cylinder block oil galleries. A regulator valve located in the lower front cover maintains a stabilized oil pressure at all\nengine speeds.\nd. Cooling System.\nThe engine cooling system includes a centrifugal-type water pump, oil cooler water jacket, thermostat housing, water manifold,\nbypass line, and cylinder block water jacket. The radiator and fan are located in the cooling system of the vehicle. The water\npump draws coolant from the radiator and circulates it through the oil cooler, cylinder block, and cylinder heads to the\nthermostat housing. During the warm-up period, the thermostat blocks coolant flow to the radiator. During this period, the\npump circulates the coolant through the bypass system to the cylinder block and cylinder heads. As the coolant reaches the\ndesignated operating temperature, the thermostat opens and the coolant is circulated through the radiator.\ne. Air Induction System.\nThe air induction system consists of a turbocharger, blower, cylinder block air box, cylinder liner intake ports, and exhaust\nvalve ports. In the scavenging process, the blower forces air into the cylinders and sweeps out the burned gases through the\nexhaust valve ports. This air also cools the internal engine parts, particularly the exhaust valves. The turbocharger converts\nexhaust energy from the burned gases and reacts to the engine\u2019s demand, determined by the flow of exhaust gases, to deliver\nthe required amount of air to the engine under all conditions.", "62": "TM 8A192D-OI\n1-13f. Crankcase Ventilation System.\nThe crankcase ventilation system consists of a breather tube assembly, a filtering element in a collector, and crankcase vapor\npassages. Seepage of a small amount of air past the piston rings maintains a slight pressure in the engine crankcase. This air\nsweeps up through the engine to draw off oil vapors through the breather elements.\ng. Electrical System\n(1) General.\nThe electrical system consists of a starter, air box heater, and related wiring.\n(2) Starter.\nThe starter is equipped with a shift lever and solenoid plunger, totally enclosed to protect it against dirt, and a sprag-\noverrunning clutch. Pressing the starting switch energizes the starter solenoid, which engages the starter pinion with the\nteeth of the flywheel ring gear. The starter drives the pinion and rotates the engine. When the engine begins to operate,\nthe sprag clutch permits the pinion to overrun on its shaft until the starting switch is released, which prevents overspeeding\nof the starter.\n(3) Air Box Heater.\nThe air box heater heats the air entering the cylinders to assist in ignition of fuel at low ambient temperatures. A fuel-and-\nair mixture is sprayed into the air box and a spark ignites a flame. The flame heats the incoming air which is fed directly\ninto the cylinders.\nh. Gear Train.\nThe gear train consists of a crankshaft gear, idler gear, fuel pump drive gear, two accessory (air compressor and hydraulic\npump) drive gears, and two camshaft gears. The gear train is located between the rear end plate and flywheel housing. All\ngear train gears are helical. The crankshaft gear is pressed and keyed to the crankshaft. The idler gear rotates on a stationary\nhub. The camshaft gears are pressed and keyed to their respective camshafts and secured by their retaining nut and locking\nplate. The camshaft gears mesh with each other and run at the same speed as the crankshaft gear. The stamped timing marks\non the face of the gears show proper timing. The overflow oil from the camshaft pockets, camshaft end bearings, and idler\ngear bearings lubricates the gear train. Oil from the cylinder block oil gallery lubricates the fuel pump drive gear, accessory\ndrive gears, and idler gear bearings.\ni. Governor System.\nThe mechanical limiting-speed governor is mounted between the blower and flywheel housing. The governor holds the injector\nracks in the advanced fuel position for starting when the speed control lever is in the idle position. Immediately after starting,\nthe governor moves the injector racks to control idle and maximum engine speed during operation.\nj. Fuel Modulator System.\nThe fuel modulator, mounted under the left cylinder head rocker cover, maintains a proper fuel-to-air ratio, where normally\nthe mechanical governor would provide maximum injector output at lower speeds. Even with the engine throttle set in a full-\nspeed position, the fuel modulator prevents the fuel injector racks from moving into the full-fuel position until the modulator\ndetects that sufficient air box air pressure is maintained to provide proper combustion.\nk. Engine Brake System.\nThe engine brake units are mounted over the rocker assemblies of each left and right bank. When the master-slave units of\nthe brake system are energized, engine oil under pressure is directed to the master-slave units as well as the drone units. The\npistons of both the master-slave and drone units are forced down by the oil pressure. The downward force is exerted on the\nexhaust valves, opening the valves when the engine reaches top dead center (TDC). The opening of the exhaust valves releases", "63": "TM 8A192D-OI\n1-14the energy, normally creating engine power, and vents the compression of the power stroke to the atmosphere, completing a\ncompression braking cycle which contributes to slowing down the vehicle and saving wear on the vehicle brake system.", "64": "TM 8A192D-OI\n1-151-9.  OPERATIONAL DESCRIPTION.\nM9901047AIR IN\nAIR\nOUT\nSCA VENGINGAIR IN\nCOMPRESSIONAIR IN\nPOWERAIR IN\nAIR\nOUT\nEXHAUST\na. General.\nThis particular engine series has a two-stroke cycle (sometimes called a two cycle). A two-stroke engine completes one cycle\n(intake, compression, power, and exhaust) every time the piston goes up and down, up being one stroke and down being the\nreturn stroke. The air intake and exhaust functions are accomplished during the compression and power strokes as explained\nin the following paragraphs.\nb. Scavenging.\nThe blower, which is an air pump that is gear driven from the crankshaft, forces air into the air box. Each cylinder has a row\nof ports in the cylinder wall opening to the air box. The ports are located at the bottom of the piston stroke. When the top of\nthe piston moves down and uncovers the ports, air in the air box is forced through the ports. The air then flows toward the\nexhaust valves and produces a scavenging effect, leaving the cylinder full of fresh air when the piston returns and covers the\nports.\nc. Compression.\nAs the piston continues the upward stroke, the exhaust valves close and the piston compresses the charge of fresh air. The fuel\ninjector injects the required amount of fuel into the cylinder shortly before the piston reaches its highest point and continues\ninto the power stroke.\nd. Power.\nThe heat generated from compression ignites the fine fuel spray to start combustion. Combustion continues until all the injected\nfuel has burned. The resulting pressure forces the piston downward on its power stroke.", "65": "TM 8A192D-OI\n1-16e. Exhaust.\nWhen the piston is approximately halfway down, the exhaust valves open and most of the high-pressure exhaust gases escape.\nShortly thereafter, the piston drops below the inlet ports in the cylinder wall. Pressurized air is then forced through the cylinder.\nDuring this process, the remaining exhaust gases are removed (or scavenged) from the cylinder.", "66": "TM 8A192D-OI\n2-1CHAPTER 2\nMAINTENANCE INSTRUCTIONS\nSECTION I.

General\n(1) When tightening lock nuts with torque wrench, apply additional torque to overcome internal friction. Measure the\ntorque required to turn the lock nut before it contacts the washer or item it is securing. Add this torque to that specified in\nthe procedure to determine total torque to apply.\n(2) Studs with damaged threads should be replaced or the threads rechased. However, this is not always possible during\nmaintenance. If it is necessary to tighten nut on stud with damaged threads, determine torque required to turn nut and add\nthis to the required torque, as done for lock nuts.\n(3) When using new nuts, bolts, and screws, it is a good practice to tighten them to their specified torque, loosen them\nabout one-half turn, and then retighten them. This aids in cleaning and smoothing the threads and results in more accurate\ntorque. When performing this procedure, do not use the torque wrench to loosen them.\n(4) Castle nuts which require the use of cotter pins should be tightened to the lower limit of the specified torque range.\nThey should then be further tightened until slot in nut aligns with hole in bolt, allowing cotter pin to be installed.\n(5) When bolt and nut are being tightened to specified torque, use the torque wrench on the nut end. This prevents loss of\ntorque caused by the bolt\u2019s binding in the hole and from friction under the bolt head. If bolt and nut must be tightened\nfrom the bolt head end, tighten to the upper limit of the specified torque range.\n(6) Washers should always be used where specified under screw heads and nuts; they help eliminate torque loss caused\nby friction and result in more accurate torque.\n(7) Threads of nuts, screws, and bolts, as well as screw holes, should be clean and dry unless the procedure specifies that\nlubricant be used. Use of lubricant where not specified could result in application of excessive torque.\n(8) It is not possible to use torque wrench to verify if nut, screw, or bolt has already been tightened to the correct torque\nvalue. The additional torque required to overcome friction can make fastening hardware that has been tightened appear to\nhave been over- or undertightened correctly. The only way to be sure it is properly tightened is to loosen it at least one-\nhalf turn and then retighten it to the correct torque value. When performing this procedure, do not use the torque wrench\nto loosen it.\n(9) A smooth, steady force must be applied to torque wrenches to obtain accurate torque values. Rapid or jerky force can\nresult in errors in torque applied.\n(10) When tightening screws, bolts, and nuts that hold covers and end plates, use crisscross tightening patterns, as shown\nwhere required in the procedures.\n(11) When tightening screws, bolts, and nuts, mark head to show screw or bolt has proper torque.\n(12) When tightening screws, bolts, and nuts in patterns, do not tighten in one step. Tighten in two or three steps. Use\nincreasing amounts of torque and repeat the pattern until specified torque is reached.", "106": "TM 8A192D-OI\n4-15M99010548\nEIGHT-BOLTFIVE-BOLT5\nFOUR-BOLT4\nSIX-BOLT631\n21\n2 34\n1\n23\n4 51\n23 4\n56\n7\nb. Torque Wrench Adapters and Crowfoot Extensions\n(1) Torque wrench adapters and crowfoot extensions allow use of torque wrenches in areas with limited access.

It must be gripped so that force is applied at the point\nfrom which torque wrench effective length was measured. This should be the center of the handgrip area.
